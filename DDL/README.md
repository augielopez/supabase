### About
DDL stands for Data Definition Language in databases. It refers to a set of SQL commands used to define and manage the structure of database objects, such as tables, indexes, views, and schemas. DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete these objects.

Common DDL commands include:

- CREATE: Used to create a new database object, such as a table or an index.
- ALTER: Used to modify the structure of an existing database object.
- DROP: Used to delete a database object.
- TRUNCATE: Used to remove all records from a table without deleting the table itself.


DDL commands are essential for setting up and maintaining the structure of a database.
